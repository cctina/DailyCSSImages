##### Other Animated Animals
1. Woodstock (From Peanuts)
2. Winnie the Pooh (From Winnie-the-Pooh)

### Note
Totoro, a character of  movie "[My neighbor Totoro](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/)" which was produced by [Studio Ghibli](http://www.ghibli.jp/). It is one of my favorite animated animals. :)

Since I made these all works slowly, I skipped the challenge for a short rest yesterday, and tried to adjust my development process. Now I am one day behind, I'll try to catch them all up soon!

##### Keywords
Not much new for this one. :P There you are:

- SASS
	- Try to use some basic conditional statements in the `@mixin`, like `@if`, `@else`.
- `unset`
	- Use `unset` as default value for **position directions**, like top / bottom / left / right. And that was great for integrate all the position mixins (see SCSS file of last work [Day-04](http://codepen.io/cctina/pen/PpoYvg)) into one.
