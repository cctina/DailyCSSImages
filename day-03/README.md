### Note
An astronaut beaver! :D Inspired by this article -- [How to Create Stylish Flat Space Icons in Adobe Photoshop | Envato Tuts+](https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-stylish-flat-space-icons-in-adobe-photoshop--cms-22984).

Use a SVG Chrome extension application -- [Boxy SVG](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boxy-svg/gaoogdonmngmdlbinmiclicjpbjhgomg?hl=en) -- to make a draft before implement. This is a good way to plan how you draw it with CSS while you design your work, also a good reference when you get started to write codes!

Still need a lot of time to implement today, but I've found a good process to do the challenge. And I think I'm getting familiar with some useful attributes and functions. :)

##### Keywords
- SASS: More `@mixin`
- Use less `clip-path`
	- Since most versions of Firefox don't support. ([Getting to support from Firefox 53+](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-clip-path))
	- Make your Firefox (locally) support it!
		- Input `about:config` in Firefox url field.
		- Find out the attribute `layout.css.clip-path-shapes.enabled`
		- Double click on the row to switch the value (From default `false` to `true`).
- `z-index`
	- When it comes to a lot layers of elements, what is the most efficeient way to manage them?
